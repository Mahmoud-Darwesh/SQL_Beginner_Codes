If you have table and want to choose specific row or multiple rows from it so lets do that 

simply we use the where query for that 

look at the code attached


1. Select All Non-Male Employees
SELECT *
FROM table name
WHERE NOT gender = "Male";


Explanation:
Retrieves all records where the gender is not "Male". This includes employees who are labeled as "Female" or any other non-male.

2. Filter by First Name Pattern – LIKE "a___"
SELECT *
FROM
WHERE first_name LIKE "a___";


Explanation:
Selects records where the first name:

Starts with the letter a

Is exactly 4 characters long

Examples: alex, anna
Does not match: amy, aaron, aiden

3. Filter by First Name Length – LIKE "____"
SELECT *
FROM
WHERE first_name LIKE "____";


Explanation:
Returns records where the first name is exactly 4 characters long, regardless of what letters it contains.

Examples: john, emma
Does not match: bob, steve

4. Filter by First Name Starting with 'a' – LIKE "a_%"
SELECT *
FROM
WHERE first_name LIKE "a_%";


Explanation:
Selects records where the first name:

Starts with the letter a
Has at least 2 characters

Always replace your_table_name with the actual name of your table, 
and you can customize the column name (e.g., first_name) depending on what you're filtering.
