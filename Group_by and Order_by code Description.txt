GROUP BY
This clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
Example: Group rows by gender to get aggregated data for each gender.

ORDER BY
This clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. By default, the sorting is ascending (ASC). You can also specify descending (DESC) if needed.
